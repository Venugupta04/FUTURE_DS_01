wa# Task 1 - Power BI Dashboard

This is my *Task 1* during the internship, where I worked with *Power BI* to build a simple yet interactive dashboard.  

## ðŸ”§ What I Used
- Power BI Desktop for creating the dashboard  
- Power Query for cleaning and shaping the data  
- DAX formulas for some basic calculations  
- Different visuals like bar charts, line charts, and slicers  

## ðŸ“– What I Learned
In this task, I learned how to take raw data and make it more meaningful.  
- I practiced cleaning and transforming the dataset before using it.  
- I got comfortable with adding slicers and filters to make the dashboard interactive.  
- I explored how to design the layout so the insights are easy to understand.  
- I understood the importance of data modeling and how relationships affect visuals.  
- Most importantly, I learned how to turn numbers into insights through visualization.  

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Download the .pbix file from this repo  
2. Open it in *Power BI Desktop*  
3. Play around with the visuals and filters to see the insights
